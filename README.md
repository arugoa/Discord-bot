# Discord-bot
This is the code for a basic discord bot, separated into various cogs for ease of reading. 
The original part of the code without the cogs is at the bottom of the main page. 
If you have any doubts, please ask, or chekc out the discordpy documentation

The bottest file includes the code for the main program, with my bots old token in it
You need to go to the discord Dev portal to create a bot with all settings at default, and then use your bots token in place of the token i put there.
